<h2>Week 1 Progress</h2>
<p>This week I learned about <i>asymptotic notation</i>, specifically <i>big O notation</i>, and the practice's use in designing,  writing, and analyzing algorithms. Defining an algorithm via its time complexity (constant, linear, quadratic, etc.) is useful when defining its specification and ensuring efficiency.</p>
